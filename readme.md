## Course Repository for CS283: Systems Programming

#### Introduction
For this course I will be using git/github to share sample programs that we will discuss in class, and you will be using an enterprise git solution such as GitHub or GitLab for your own work and submitting programming assignments.

GitHub is an excellent platform for you to showcase your work.  You may use it for this class, but if you do, your repository needs to be publically accessable to make things easier.  If you want to keep your work private please use Drexel's GitLab service.

#### Creating a `git` repo on GitHub

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository

2. Create a directory for your work files.

3. Make sure your linux platform has the `git` tool installed.  It will be there if you are using `tux`.  If you are using a local virtual machine you can install git using the directions here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

4. Follow the directions provided by GitHub or GitLab to associate your local directory with your centralized repository.
